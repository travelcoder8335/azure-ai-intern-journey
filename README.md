# Azure AI Intern Journey 🚀

This repository documents my 12-week AI Engineer Internship focused on Azure Machine Learning and Cloud-based AI systems.

## 🎯 Objective

To build strong foundations in:
- Virtual Environments & Dependency Management
- Git & Version Control
- Cloud Computing Fundamentals
- Azure Machine Learning
- Model Training & Deployment
- MLOps Concepts

---

## 📅 Daily Learning Log

### Day 1 – Internship Begins
- Set up GitHub repository
- Understood internship roadmap
- Initialized learning documentation

### Day 2 – Core Foundations
- Learned about Virtual Environments (Isolation)
- Understood Git for Version Control
- Studied Cloud Computing basics
- Connected concepts to Azure ML Workspace

---

## 📘 What I Learned So Far

### 1️⃣ Virtual Environments (Isolation)

A virtual environment allows Python projects to have isolated dependencies.  
This prevents version conflicts between machine learning projects.

In Azure ML, training jobs run in isolated environments (containers).  
Understanding this helps prevent dependency-related errors.

---

### 2️⃣ Git (Version Control)

Git tracks changes in code over time.  
In AI projects, this is critical for:

- Experiment tracking
- Reproducibility
- Collaboration
- Safe iteration

---

###  3️⃣Cloud Basics

Cloud computing allows AI models to be trained on powerful remote machines.

Key components:
- Compute (VMs, GPU clusters)
- Storage (Datastores, Blob Storage)
- Networking (Secure connections between services)

Azure ML leverages these components to train and deploy models at scale.

## 🧠 Reflection

Understanding these fundamentals helped me see how real-world AI systems are built.  
Before this, I focused mainly on model training locally.  
Now I understand the importance of environment isolation, version control, and scalable cloud infrastructure.

More updates coming daily.
##   How All Three Work Together in Real AI Workflow

Let’s connect everything clearly:

---------Step 1️⃣  — You create project locally-----------


*Create virtual environment

*Install scikit-learn

*Write training script

--------Step 2️⃣  — Use Git-----------------------

*Commit code

*Push to GitHub

-----------Step 3️⃣ — Use Azure ML--------------

*Azure pulls code

*Creates cloud environment

*Trains model on GPU compute

*Saves model in cloud storage

### Real Industry Flow

AI Engineer workflow:

Create isolated environment

Develop model

Track experiments with Git

Push to cloud

Train at scale

Deploy API endpoint
