# Azure AI Intern Journey 🚀

This repository documents my 12-week AI Engineer Internship focused on Azure Machine Learning and Cloud-based AI systems.

## 🎯 Objective

To build strong foundations in:
- Virtual Environments & Dependency Management
- Git & Version Control
- Cloud Computing Fundamentals
- Azure Machine Learning
- Model Training & Deployment
- MLOps Concepts

## 📅 Daily Learning Log

### Day 1 – Internship Begins
- Set up GitHub repository
- Understood internship roadmap
- Initialized learning documentation

### Day 2 – Core Foundations
- Learned about Virtual Environments (Isolation)
- Understood Git for Version Control
- Studied Cloud Computing basics
- Connected concepts to Azure ML Workspace

## 📘 What I Learned So Far

### 1️⃣ Virtual Environments (Isolation)

A virtual environment allows Python projects to have isolated dependencies.  
This prevents version conflicts between machine learning projects.

In Azure ML, training jobs run in isolated environments (containers).  
Understanding this helps prevent dependency-related errors.

---

### 2️⃣ Git (Version Control)

Git tracks changes in code over time.  
In AI projects, this is critical for:

- Experiment tracking
- Reproducibility
- Collaboration
- Safe iteration

---

### 3️⃣ Cloud Basics

Cloud computing allows AI models to be trained on powerful remote machines.

Key components:
- Compute (VMs, GPU clusters)
- Storage (Datastores, Blob Storage)
- Networking (Secure connections between services)

Azure ML leverages these components to train and deploy models at scale.

## 🧠 Reflection

Understanding these fundamentals helped me see how real-world AI systems are built.  
Before this, I focused mainly on model training locally.  
Now I understand the importance of environment isolation, version control, and scalable cloud infrastructure.
